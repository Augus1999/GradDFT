"""The goal of this module is to test that the loss functions in ~/grad_dft/train.py are
trainable and minimizable given a simple neural functional and only two H Solid objects in
the training set. These tests do the same as in ~/tests/molecules/test_training.py but we are testing for Solids
instead.

For SCF and non-SCF training, we should have:


(1) Loss function gradients free of NaN's

(2) Decreased loss after 5 iterations of an optimizer
